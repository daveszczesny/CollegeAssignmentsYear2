hashF1 method
----------------------------------------------------

hashF1 takes in a string

hashA int array defined on line 77
on line 83 we check if the string is less than 1 or more than 64 chars
and set ret to -1 if it is
if it isn't
we add the string to our filler and cut it to 64 chars
we then loop through them adding to our hashA method
multiplying each numeric character value by prime numbers
line 97 to 100 we mod hashA to 255 for an 8bit ASCII

We then let ret equal to the hash values, with each element being
multiplied by 8bit for ASCII

this gives us our hash
